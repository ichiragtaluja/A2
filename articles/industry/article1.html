          About 3,900 United Auto Workers members with Mack Trucks will go on
          strike Monday after a majority of members rejected a tentative
          agreement reached last week by the union and company. The tentative
          agreement was voted down by 73% of UAW members who voted, the union
          said Sunday night. Workers at facilities in Pennsylvania, Maryland and
          Florida will strike starting at 7 a.m. Monday, UAW announced online.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Mack Trucks workers will add to tens of thousands of other
          striking UAW members, most notably more than 25,000 employees with
          General Motors , Ford Motor and Stellantis . The union launched
          targeted strikes at select facilities against the Detroit automakers
          beginning Sept. 15. The union’s since expanded the strikes at each of
          the automakers. The Mack Trucks deal was viewed as a potential test of
          the willingness of workers to ratify a deal that didn’t meet raised
          expectations set by UAW President Shawn Fain for record contracts for
          hourly pay increases, equal pay for equal work, inflation protection
          and shorter work weeks.
        </p>
        <p>
          One Mack Trucks worker descried the deal as “disgraceful” and an
          “insult” compared to their expectations and what’s currently being
          negotiated by UAW international leaders with the Detroit automakers,
          also known as the Big Three.
