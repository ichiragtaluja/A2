          A year after the Biden administration took its first major step toward
          restricting the sale of semiconductors to China, it has begun drafting
          additional limits aimed at denying Beijing the technology critical to
          modern-day weapons. But in recent months, its progress has been slowed
          as American chip companies have pushed back with a blunt warning:
          Cutting sales to China would gut their businesses and derail the
          administration’s plan to build new semiconductor factories in the
          United States. Since July, Nvidia, Intel and Qualcomm, three of the
          world’s largest chip makers, have pressed their case that cracking
          down on China would have unintended consequences.

          They have challenged the White House’s national security wisdom in
          meetings with officials like Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken and
          Commerce Secretary Gina M. Raimondo, wooed think tanks and urged
          leaders across Washington to reconsider additional chip controls,
          according to interviews with two dozen officials across the
          government, industry and policy organizations. The companies have
          warned that a U.S. pullback could accelerate China’s development of an
          independent chip industry, paving the way to a world dominated by
          Chinese-created chips rather than American-designed chips.
