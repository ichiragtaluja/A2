          Deepfakes use artificial intelligence (AI) to make a video of someone
          by manipulating their face or body. One such video appeared on TikTok
          this week, claiming to be MrBeast offering people new iPhones for $2
          (Â£1.65). Meanwhile, likenesses of BBC stars Matthew Amroliwala and
          Sally Bundock were used to promote a known scam.

          The video on Facebook showed the journalists "introducing" Elon Musk,
          the billionaire owner of X, formerly Twitter, purportedly promoting an
          investment opportunity. Similar historical videos have claimed to show
          him giving away money and cryptocurrency. The BBC approached
          Facebook-owner Meta from comment and the content has since been
          removed. Previously, the videos were gated by an image warning viewers
          that they contained false information checked by independent
          fact-checkers FullFact, which first reported the issue.

          "We don't allow this kind of content on our platforms and have removed
          it," said a Meta spokesperson. "We're constantly working to improve
          our systems and encourage anyone who sees content they believe breaks
          our rules to report it using our in-app tools so we can investigate
          and take action." Meanwhile, a TikTok spokesperson said the company
          removed the MrBeast ad within a few hours of it being uploaded, and
          the account which posted it has been removed for violating its
          policies.
